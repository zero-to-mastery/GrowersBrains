# GrowersBrains

GrowersBrains is an app designed to solve the problems that growers globally are Facing and to bring expert growing techniques to everyone. Grow Green and Grow Clean.

As a community project that will enable collaborators to:

:heavy_check_mark: Sharpen their skill sets

:heavy_check_mark: Learn new languages

:heavy_check_mark: Work in a team environment

:heavy_check_mark: Get real world experience

:heavy_check_mark: Make something that helps the world

:heavy_check_mark: learn all about the process of taking an app from idea to product

:heavy_check_mark: and most importantly, have fun along the way.

# Motivation

The way that I came up with the idea is that I have 15 years of experience of growing plants. Starting in middle school Horticulture class at 11 up to now at 26, I've learned a lot from books and the internet but the place that I have always learned the most was from other growers teaching me the techniques that took them years to develop and perfect.

This lead me to the idea of creating an app that brings a collective consciousness of **growers** together to change the way the world grows. Growing plants can be expensive and can lead to great losses if not done properly. When done properly it can be a fun, exciting and relaxing way to control the quality of the food or medicine that you are growing and ensure that it is as clean and pure as possible.

### Tech Stack

:rocket: React

:flying_saucer: Node

:artificial_satellite: MongoDB

:airplane: Express

# Features & Designs

The current design that I have for the app is to have eight different sections.

### Sections

All of these features would allow for great data to be collected and machine learning to be created to diagnose plant problems, and make elite growing accessible to everyone no matter their experience level.
